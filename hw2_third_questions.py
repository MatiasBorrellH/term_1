# Now imagine you have a certain data structure that
# contains information about different countries and
# the number of people who was registered with covid
# in a weekly basis.
# e.g. {'Spain': [4, 8, 2, 0, 1], 'France': [2, 3, 6],
#       'Italy': [6, 8, 1, 7]}
# Assuming that the moment they started reporting the
# number of registered cases is not the same (thus
# the length of the lists can differ)


# 7)
# Create a function called "total_registered_cases"
# that has 2 parameters:
# 1) The data structure described above.
# 2) A string with the country name.
#
# The function should return the total number of cases
# registered so far in that country

# Parameters of the function: 1) a dictionary with the weekly case data, 2) the name of the country

    # if the country exists in the dictionary, the function will sum all cases in the specified country
    if country in data:

    else:

# 8)
# Create a function called "total_registered_cases_per_country"
# that has 1 parameter:
# 1) The data structure described above.
#
# The function should return a dictionary with a key
# per each country and as value the total number of cases
# registered so far that the country had.

# Parameters of the function: 1) The data structure described above.

    # The function will return the new dictionary with the total number of cases per country
    return total_cases_per_country

# 9)
# Create a function called "country_with_most_cases"
# that has 1 parameter:
# 1) The data structure described above
#
# The function should return the country with the
# greatest total amount of cases

# Parameters of the function: 1) The data structure described above.
def country_with_most_cases(data):
    # Create new dictionary using the function defined in Ex. 8.
    sum_dict = total_registered_cases_per_country(data)
